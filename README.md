this project was challenging because I tried to follow best practices and guidelines like creating functions that create/append divs, which did make the project go smoother; but, the work was more front-loaded.

in this project, I learned: 

    to streamline code with factory functions

    to map/connect modules with each other

    to better name/call functions/objects

    use JS to create forms
